# Project-1
This app allows a user to enter ingredients into a search bar and use an API to search for
recipes that contain those ingredients.  A list of relevant recipes are then displayed to the user with information such as how long the recipe takes to make, any health warnings, and how many calories it contains.  The user can then favorite these recipes and store them within a firebase database.  The user can click a button to view the stored favorites.  The favorites are stored withn the database separated by the user's email address so that multiple user's can each have a favorites list.  This app uses firebase user authentication which asks the user to sign into the app.  The app uses this email to organize the database.

This app was created using the following technologies:  HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Firebase, the edamam API, and google user authentication
